# Image Quilting for Texture Synthesis and Transfer

![Demo](abstract_screenshot.PNG)

To quote the original paper's abstract at https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~efros/research/quilting.html:

>We present a simple image-based method of generating novel visual appearance 
in which a new image is synthesized by stitching
together small patches of existing images. We call this process image quilting.

>First, we use quilting as a fast and very simple texture
synthesis algorithm which produces surprisingly good results for
a wide range of textures.

>Second, we extend the algorithm to perform texture transfer â€“ rendering an object with a texture taken from
a different object. More generally, we demonstrate how an image
can be re-rendered in the style of a different image.

>The method
works directly on the images and does not require 3D information.

In this repository, we will be implementing the paper using Python and NumPy.

## Texture Synthesis

The algorithm starts with an input image and a block size:

![input block](input.png)

We then define a minimum cost path between the overlap of two blocks:

We then build up a synthesized image by tiling small blocks of the input image.

(a) Here, we just randomly choose blocks

(b) Here we pick blocks that have the least overlap error

(c) We do everything in (c) but also cut along the minimum error boundary.
